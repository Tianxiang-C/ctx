abstract: "In this meta-analysis, we summarized findings on the associations between body
dissatisfaction and suicide-related behaviors [suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and
non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI)]. A literature search identified 86 relevant articles in
which 231 effect sizes for these associations were reported. Using a three-level
random-effects meta-analytic model, we calculated average effect sizes in separate
analyses of data from clinical and non-clinical samples. Mean effect sizes (r values)
for the relationships between body dissatisfaction and suicidal ideation, suicide
attempts, and NSSI in clinical samples were 0.28 [95% confidence interval (CI),
0.21–0.35; standard error (SE), 0.04; *t* = 7.84, *p* < 0.001], 0.21 (95% CI, 0.16–0.26;
SE, 0.03; *t* = 7.80, *p* < 0.001), and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.19–0.32; SE, 0.04; *t* = 7.33, *p* <
0.001), respectively. In non-clinical samples, these values were 0.19 (95% CI, 0.13–
0.24; SE, 0.03; *t* = 6.50, *p* < 0.001), 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11–0.22; SE, 0.03; *t* = 6.52, *p* <
0.001), and 0.22 (95% CI, 0.15–0.29; SE, 0.04; *t* = 6.08, *p* < 0.001), respectively.
Several study features (e.g., participant age, survey method, and instrument validity)
emerged as significant moderators. Potential explanations, implications, and future
research directions are discussed.

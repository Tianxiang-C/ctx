Welcome to my website! I'm CUI Tianxiang (崔天祥), a PhD student in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.um.edu.mo/fss/psychology/), [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/), supervised by Prof. [TONG Kwok Kit](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DECUuZkAAAAJ&hl=en). I'm also a research assistant in [SCI-Cream Lab](https://sci-cream.netlify.app/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), working under Prof. [HE Jinbo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=16qDmvsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works)'s supervision. 

I served as a part-time translator at [Chengdu Language Bridge Translation Co.,Ltd.](https://www.lan-bridge.com/) from 2020 to 2021. One of the accomplishments was the translation (from English to Chinese) of [The Story of Pokémon](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58076959-the-story-of-pok-mon) in 2021, which could be available on Chinese e-commerce platforms in 2023 (I've been a fan of Pokémon since primary school). In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, practicing calligraphy, listening to music, singing, etc.

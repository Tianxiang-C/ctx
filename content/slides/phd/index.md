# Timeline-Language Test Scores

- Took the IELTS test in late November

  - Proof of English instruction alone may not be enough

  - It is better to take another language test for more advantages (especially if the language score has expired)

# Tips

- Actively participate in research projects

- Need to know more about the supervisor you are applying to

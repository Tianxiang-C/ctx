abstract: "**Objective**: The present study developed a 15-item Muscle Bias Internalization Scale (MBIS) which measures the extent to which men endorse muscle-based stereotypes and negative self-evaluations due to muscle mass. 


**Methods**: Two independent samples were recruited online at different time points. The first sample consisted of 300 adult men, with a mean age of 29.98 (*SD* = 7.81) years and a mean BMI of 22.75 (*SD* = 2.56) kg/m2. The second sample also contained 300 adult men who had a mean age of 29.5 (*SD* = 7.50) years and a mean BMI of 23.06 (*SD* = 2.59) kg/m2. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used in the first sample to explore the factor structure of the MBIS. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used in the second sample to confirm the factor structure of the MBIS derived from EFA. Within the second sample, reliability and validity of the MBIS were also explored.


**Results**: The MBIS showed a three-factor structure in EFA, which was confirmed in CFA with good model fit. The total scale score of the MBIS showed high internal consistency reliability (*α* = .94) and high two-week test-retest reliability (ICC = .86). The MBIS also demonstrated construct validity by presenting significant correlations with theoretically related constructs (e.g., weight bias internalization and muscularity-oriented body image and eating disturbances).


**Conclusion**: The newly developed MBIS can be a valuable and promising tool for assessing muscle bias in men. It may help understand the role of such perception biases in the development and maintenance of muscularity-oriented body image and eating disturbances.

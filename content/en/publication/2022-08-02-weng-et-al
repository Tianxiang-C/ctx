abstract: "

Objective: This study examined the bidirectional relationships between sleep quality, loss of
control (LOC) eating, and night eating among Chinese adolescents using longitudinal data over
an 18-month study period.

Method: Four-waves of data measurement (Times 1-4), at 6-month intervals, were conducted
with 2566 adolescents aged 11 ~ 17 years at baseline. A set of questionaries were used to assess
night eating, LOC eating, and sleep quality at each wave of data collection. Cross-lagged models
were applied to analyze the bidirectional relationships among night eating, LOC eating, and
sleep quality.

Results: Results indicated that higher night eating scores consistently predicted poorer sleep
quality and higher LOC eating scores at Time 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, poorer sleep quality
predicted higher night eating scores at Time 1 and Time 3, and higher LOC eating scores
predicted higher night eating scores at Time 1 to Time 2.

Discussion: These findings highlight that night eating, LOC eating, and sleep quality were
interrelated across time among Chinese adolescents. Improving sleep quality and reducing LOC
eating might be promising in the prevention of night eating in adolescents. Similarly, reducing
night eating might be promising in improving sleep quality and reducing LOC eating in
adolescents."

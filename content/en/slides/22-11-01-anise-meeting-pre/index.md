**Presenter**: CUI Tianxiang

### Contents



---

### Topic

- The relationship between two constructs
- The effect of an intervention
- The structure of a model
- ...

---

### Keywords
- Refer to previous meta-analyses

---
### Keywords
- Use "\*" when variations are needed (e.g., therap* includes therapy, therapies, theraputic, etc.)
- Use "" to include pharses (e.g., "body image")
- Use "AND" and "OR" correctly

---
### Databases

- PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses (PQDT)
  - Focus on title and abstract
  - Export the records (with abstract) to files (RIS / Bibtex...) that can be imported to the reference manager (Zotero / Endnote / Mendeley ...)
- Supplementary: Google Scholar

---
### Records

- Remove duplicates (Zotero seems to work better, but is not perfect)
- Screen title and abstract of the literature by yourself or cooperate with another student (create a shared library or export half of the literature)
- Download potentially qualified articles

---
### Selection Criteria
- General inclusion criteria & exclusion criteria
  - Include English articles, exclude review articles and qualitative studies...
- Specific criteria
  - Depend on the topic

---
### Selection Criteria

- English articles only
  - Language restrictions won’t lead to systematic bias (Morrison et al., 2012).
- Unpublished articles (dissertations)
  - Rare overestimating treatment effect (Schmucker et al., 2017)
  - “Time, effort and cost”
  - Easy access, low bias and complete demonstration of findings (Moyer et al., 2010)
  - A better representation of missing study (Ferguson & Brannick, 2012)

---

### Record Important Information 
- Search results
  - Keywords and references
  - Time period (you may need to search literature twice or even three times)
  - Number of articles (total, after removing duplicates, after checking titles and abstracts, after checking the full texts)

---

### Methods
- Procedure and materials
  - Participants in the **blindfolded condition**
    - The same procedure as the blind participants


---

### Results


- ANOVA
  - The within-participants variable: the ratings for the two bodies with the different WHRs (0.70 and 0.84)
  - Between-participants variables: group (blind, sighted, and blindfolded) and order of rating (first 0.70 versus first 0.84)



---

### Results
- ANOVA
  - A significant main effect of WHR (participants overall preferred a lower WHR)
  - No other significant effects (main effects of group, interactions of WHR with group, WHR with order, and the The three-way interaction between WHR, order, and group)


---

### Results

- Paired *t* tests within each group: significant effects of WHR

  - Blind group, *d* = 0.68
  - Sighted group, *d* = 1.33
  - Blindfolded group, *d* = 0.54

### Results

### Discussion

- Visual input is not necessary for low WHR preferences
- Visual input may have strengthened this preference among sighted men
- Why do blind men develop a preference for low WHRs?
  - Verbal information
  - Generic psychological mechanisms / Prototypical stimuli
  - Intrinsic factors


---

### Limitations

- Not feasible to examine preferences of blind and sighted men for a larger number of WHRs
- Did not systematically manipulate some variables
  - Hip size, waist size, and weight

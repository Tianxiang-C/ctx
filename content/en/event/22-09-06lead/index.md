Week 3 discussion questions for PSYC8813 (Seminar in Selected Topics in Psychology). To be specific, the selected topic (it may change every semestar/year) in autumn 2022 was Social Psychology of Close Relationships, instructed by Prof. [CHI Peilian](https://www.um.edu.mo/fss/psychology/staff_Peilian.html). The week 3 topic was Evolutionary Theories, and I was the discussion leader.

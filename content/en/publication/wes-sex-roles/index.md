abstract: "Given existing empirical support for the tripartite influence and upward/downward body image comparison models to explain variance in body dissatisfaction and disordered eating across diverse populations in the Western context, research is needed to describe these models in non-Western populations to build upon the generalizability of effects. The present study tested an integrated model inclusive of sociocultural appearance pressures (Sociocultural Attitudes Toward Appearance Questionnaire 4-Revised) and body image comparisons (Upward/Downward Physical Appearance Comparison Scales) in relation to body dissatisfaction (i.e., drive for muscularity; Drive for Muscularity Scale, Female Muscularity Scale) and disordered eating (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire-Short) in heterosexual Chinese adult men (*n* = 510) and women (*n* = 473). Separated by sex, two integrated models had good fit statistics per structural equation modeling. In both men and women, higher appearance pressures were uniquely related to higher drive for muscularity and thinness-oriented disordered eating. In men and women, higher upward body image comparisons were uniquely related to higher drive for muscularity, while for men only, higher downward body image comparisons were uniquely related to higher thinness-oriented disordered eating. The present findings, which extend theories of eating pathology, may aid in improving treatment efforts for body dissatisfaction and disordered eating among heterosexual Chinese adult men and women.
